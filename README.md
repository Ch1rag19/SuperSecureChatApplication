**In this project, you and a partner are developing a super secure communication1 system using
Raspberry Pi microcontroller kits to build custom terminals to communicate with each other. The
communication is peer-to-peer between the Raspberry Pi peers, but they communicate with the
server to log into the system and to get information. Once the communication between Pi
terminals is established, the server is idle.
This project can be developed in stages. Encryption is desirable but adds a layer of complexity
therefore it can be left out initially. The most important is the communication between the client
(Raspberry Pi terminal) and the server. As the client-server interaction progresses, the client
moves through several states. The demonstration will be considered successful if the terminals
manage to connect for one round trip exchange: “Hello, are you there?”, “Yes, here I am!”.**
